/// @defgroup AudioLevel Sound-level analysis for one block of samples
/// @{
/// The loudness path: a block of microphone samples in, one level byte out.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// This is pure domain maths with no platform header, so it is host-tested without a device.
/// The platform owns only the read that produces the samples, the same host-testable shape the RMT and slot encoders take.
///
/// ## Why the scale is logarithmic
///
/// The magnitude-to-byte mapping is shared with the spectrum path, so a VU meter and a spectrum bar scale alike.
/// A magnitude is taken to decibels and mapped through a window onto the byte range.
///
/// The noise floor sets the window's bottom, and the gain is sensitivity in the intuitive direction: a higher gain narrows the window, so a sound fills more of the range.
///
/// Human hearing is logarithmic and these magnitudes span a huge range, so a linear map would crush the quiet or saturate the loud.
/// This is the standard fix.
///
/// ## Why the saturation bound is not the type's maximum
///
/// Casting a float outside the integer range is undefined, and a settling transient can briefly push the filter's output past the bounds, so it saturates first.
/// The positive bound is the largest float strictly below two to the thirty-first, not the type's maximum.
/// That maximum has no exact float and rounds up to a value itself out of range.
/// Clamping to it would still cast out of range.
/// The negative bound is exactly representable, so it needs no such care.
///
/// ## The three range constants
///
/// A learned follower credits its input with some minimum dynamic range, which exists only to bound the window it divides by; a collapsed follower would otherwise drive that toward infinity.
/// It is deliberately small, because the silence gate is what keeps a quiet room quiet and this is not a second mechanism for the same job.
/// A large value flattens real music instead: at twelve decibels a band swinging six filled only half the display, which reads as vivid bands with no dynamic range.
/// The gate can tell silence from a quiet passage, which a range clamp fundamentally cannot, so the gate does that work and this stays out of the way.
///
/// The level's own minimum is larger, for the same reason its gate sits lower: it follows a whole block's RMS, which swings far less than any single band's peak.
/// At the band's value the meter stretched that small natural variation to full scale and sat pinned at the top.
///
/// The level is scaled by gain rather than sized from it.
/// Gain sizes the band window directly, but a block RMS covers far more decibels than a single bin's peak.
/// Feeding one raw number to both left the meter in its bottom third at the settings that made the spectrum look right.
/// Scaling keeps the knob meaning what it means in both paths, and twenty decibels is the room's measured speech-to-quiet range on the bench parts.
///
/// ## Why the level's silence gate differs from a band's
///
/// A band gate reads a single bin's peak magnitude, while the level reads the whole block's RMS, which for real music sits well below the strongest bin.
/// Gating both at the band threshold left the spectrum lively with the meter pinned at zero.
///
/// The window floor is the level a manual setup displays, so it is audible by definition, and silence sits a fixed margin below it.
///
/// ## What an I2S microphone forces
///
/// Two facts about a MEMS part drive the maths, both straight from how it behaves rather than from any tuning recipe.
///
/// It carries a DC bias: the sample stream sits on a large constant offset.
/// A plain RMS would be dominated by the bias and a silent room would read as loud.
/// The block mean is subtracted first.
///
/// Its quietest output is hiss rather than zero, so a noise-floor threshold treats anything below it as silence and idle hiss never twitches the LEDs.
/// The gain then scales what is left.
///
/// The sample format is 24-bit signed data left-justified in a 32-bit slot, so the magnitude lives in the top bits.
/// An arithmetic shift lands it in an integer, and the accumulation is 64-bit so a full block cannot overflow.
/// The display window in dB: where it starts and how wide it is. One home for the two knobs.
