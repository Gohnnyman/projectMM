/// @defgroup AudioBands Frequency analysis for one block of samples
/// @{
/// The FFT post-processing: magnitude bins in, sixteen band bytes and a dominant peak out.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// This is pure domain maths with no platform header, the FFT kernel itself being the one seam.
/// It is host-tested by feeding a synthesised sine through the window, the desktop's own transform and the band grouping.
/// The test then asserts the dominant band and peak frequency, all without a device.
///
/// ## Why every band must own a bin
///
/// A pure geometric split gives each band an equal frequency ratio, which is the textbook mapping of linear bins onto pitch and is scale-free.
/// The transform is not: below twice the bin width there are no distinct bins to hand out, so the low edges collide.
///
/// Measured at the shipped shape, two bands owned no bins at all and two owned one, while the top band owned seventy-five.
/// A quarter of the display could not respond to anything, and it was the quarter where music has its energy.
///
/// So the geometric curve is kept and then made monotonic by construction: every band gets at least one bin, taken from the wide top bands that have them to spare.
/// The result stays log-shaped where the transform can afford it and degrades to one bin a band where it cannot.
/// That is the honest answer at the bottom of the range.
/// No split can separate two nearby low tones when they share a bin.
///
/// The edges are computed once per rate change and never per frame, and the summing loop costs the same additions wherever they sit.
///
/// ## What a band conditioner learns
///
/// Every band carries two learned numbers.
/// Its floor is the level it reads with no program material: the microphone's own noise, mains hum and the room.
/// That is followed as a running minimum which drifts up slowly, so a room growing noisier is re-learned.
/// Its peak is followed with an instant attack and a release of seconds, so it settles to the band's typical loudest level rather than tracking every beat.
///
/// Between the two is the band's own dynamic range, and the correction maps that onto the display window.
/// Without it the treble sits at a fraction of the bass under spectrally balanced material.
/// A peak-per-band reading of pink noise falls as the inverse root of frequency across the sixteen.
///
/// ## How much of that correction is applied
///
/// The correction takes a compressor's ratio, removing that share of a band's deviation from the window.
/// One to one is off and the music's balance is untouched, two to one halves the rig's coloration, and a high ratio flattens it.
///
/// It is slow on purpose: a fast per-band gain is what causes cross-spectral pumping, and every source on multiband dynamics says not to.
/// A maximum gain caps the lift, so a silent band is never amplified into its own noise.
/// Turning learning off freezes both tables, which is the deterministic mode a show wants.
///
/// The state is thirty-two floats, and the work is sixteen logarithms and a handful of multiplies per block, on the audio path and never per light.
///
/// ## How an onset is decided
///
/// The decision is the textbook one: flux against its own recent mean rather than an absolute threshold.
/// A loud room and a quiet one therefore fire on the same kind of event.
/// A refractory window then makes one hit one onset, however many blocks it spans.
///
/// The mean is an exponential average in fixed point, advanced after the decision so a hit does not raise the bar it is being judged against.
/// A hit is flux above a configurable fraction of that mean plus a margin.
///
/// ## Why the gate must also stop the learning
///
/// A band below the silence threshold carries no program material, so it reads zero and is not learned from, and both halves of that matter.
///
/// Without the gate the lift is dominated by the distance from the window floor.
/// That relocates a silent band upward as eagerly as a quiet instrument, so an empty room is displayed at full scale.
/// Measured on the bench, the raw path read a flux of nought to three while the learner made thirty-three to sixty-eight of it.
///
/// Learning from silence also drags the floor table down to the noise, so the next wobble reads as music.
///
/// ## Why a band's silence gate carries no margin
///
/// The gate sits at the window floor, with no margin, unlike the level path's.
///
/// ## Why the margin would have to be tuned
/// The two measure different quantities.
/// A band reports the peak magnitude of its bins while the level reports the block's RMS, and a peak sits far above an RMS for the same sound.
/// The same margin in decibels is therefore a much larger concession on a band.
///
/// Measured on the bench in a quiet room, the spectrum reads a flux of one or two at the window floor.
/// A twenty-decibel margin takes it to fifty or more, with onsets firing.
/// That is the room's own noise displayed as music.
/// A margin large enough to matter would have to be tuned per part, which is exactly what the learner exists to avoid.
///
/// The cost is real and accepted.
/// A band below the window is primed once and returns early, so its learned floor does not track a room that grows quieter still.
/// That band is dark either way, and re-learning starts the moment anything audible arrives.
///
/// ## Textbook spectrum analysis, nothing exotic
///
/// The window is a Hann, the standard general-purpose choice.
/// Tapering the block's edges to zero stops spectral leakage, where a tone smears across many bins because the block is not a whole number of cycles.
/// It also strips the DC offset while converting the samples to floats.
///
/// The band grouping folds the transform's magnitude bins into sixteen log-spaced bands, because pitch is logarithmic and bass needs few bins where treble needs many.
/// The split is a plain geometric one of equal ratio, the result normalises onto the byte range, and the single loudest bin becomes the dominant peak.

/// The Hann window's coefficient at sample `i` of `n`.
