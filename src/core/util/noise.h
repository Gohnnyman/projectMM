/// @defgroup noise Gradient noise
/// @{
/// A smooth, deterministic pseudo-random field: the staple organic-motion source for effects.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// The value varies smoothly across space, so neighbouring coordinates give similar results, unlike a raw hash.
/// Sample it across a grid for clouds, plasma or fire-like fields, and scroll a coordinate to animate.
/// One gradient set and one interpolation serve all three dimensions.
///
/// ## The algorithm
///
/// This is Perlin's improved noise.
/// A pseudo-random gradient sits at every lattice corner, chosen by a hash from the twelve cube-edge directions.
/// Its dot product with the offset from the corner, a quintic fade on the fraction, and a linear blend across the corners give the value.
///
/// Gradient noise is zero at every lattice point and has no value bias toward the corners.
/// That is why it reads as smooth and isotropic where value noise, which picks a random value per corner, reads blocky and axis-aligned at low frequency.
///
/// Two dimensions is three with the last offset at zero.
/// One takes gradients of its own, since the cube-edge set projected onto a single axis is zero for six codes of sixteen.
/// The cost scales with the corners: two, four and eight dot products.
///
/// ## Why the gradients are a table
///
/// A table rather than the usual select expression, because the selects compile to branches and a core without a branch predictor pays for each one.
/// The select form was forty-four branches per two-dimensional sample on this target; the table is loads and small multiplies.
///
/// ## Why the core works a slice at a time
///
/// One instantiation per arity compiles to straight-line code over exactly its corners.
/// A slice is two or four corners with the blends between them, and three dimensions is that slice at two depths blended by the depth fade.
///
/// One body with eight corners in flight spilled half its registers on a sixteen-register window, fifty-two stack stores a sample.
/// The slice form keeps at most four.
///
/// ## Why the scale is per arity
///
/// Halving regardless is right for two and three dimensions and wrong for one, which then spans only the middle half of the range.
/// Measured, a one-dimensional field covered the central half of the byte range and read washed out beside the same field sampled in two.
///
/// ## The three standard compositions
///
/// One sample is a smooth blur; the looks people recognise come from composing samples, and each composition is a few lines over the base rather than a new field generator.
///
/// Summing octaves at doubling frequency and halving amplitude turns the blur into cloud, terrain or smoke structure: large shapes with fine detail on them.
/// The same sum over the absolute deviation creases the field, and those creases read as billows and flame.
/// Sampling at a coordinate that noise itself displaced is the warp, which produces the flowing, marbled look.
///
/// Cost is stated per call because it decides whether an effect fits.
/// Each octave is one sample, so three octaves cost three, and a warp costs its own probes plus the field it then samples.
/// On a large fixture that multiplies by the pixel count.
///
/// ## What a domain warp is for
///
/// A warp displaces the sample coordinate by a noise field and then samples there, the strength saying how far that reaches in the same units as the coordinates.
/// It is the primitive behind the flowing, marbled look.
/// The field stops looking like a texture laid on the grid and starts looking like something moving through it, for two extra samples.
///
/// ## Why the volumetric warp takes three probes
///
/// It uses three rather than two, each offset by its own constant so the axes displace independently.
/// Sampling one field three times would move everything along a diagonal.
///
/// Its octave count has no default, unlike the flat form's.
/// With one, the two four-argument calls would both be viable and every existing call ambiguous, so requiring it makes the arity say which field the caller means.
///
/// Both share one body, so the two cannot drift apart.
/// Each still compiles to exactly its own arity: the flat instantiation walks four corners and never touches the third axis.
/// Calling the volumetric body with a zero third coordinate would have been simpler and measured nearly twice as slow.
/// Every probe and the inner sum then walk eight corners to reach the same answer.
///
/// ## Why curl noise cannot clump
///
/// It is the perpendicular gradient of a scalar field, from Bridson's curl-noise paper.
/// Taking the gradient of a potential and turning it a quarter turn gives a field whose divergence is zero by construction.
/// Whatever flows into a region flows out again.
///
/// That is what separates it from sampling noise straight into a velocity, where the field has sources and sinks.
/// Anything carried by such a field collects in the sinks and drains from the sources, which looks like clumping rather than flow.
///
/// The output is scaled by a strength in the caller's own units, and the sampling distance for the central difference is in the same coordinates as the field.
/// Too small and the difference is quantization noise; too large and the curl is of a blurrier field than the one being sampled.
/// The default is a sixteenth of a cell.
///
/// ## The output uses its full range
///
/// The dot product is signed offsets added, so the blend spans about a cell rather than the tighter bound a unit vector suggests.
/// An exact search over every gradient choice at every fraction gives half a cell in one dimension, a cell in two and slightly more in three.
///
/// Each tier halves the raw blend onto its range, so the midpoint is the field's mean and both ends are reached.
/// The clamp is a guard that only the three-dimensional extreme touches.
///
/// ## How a coordinate is read
///
/// A coordinate is fixed point scaled however the caller likes: its high byte selects the noise cell and its low byte the interpolation position within.
/// A larger step per pixel is therefore finer noise, with more cells across the grid, and a smaller step is broader and smoother.
///
/// ## What the lattice hash costs
///
/// Each coordinate is multiplied by its own odd constant and the results xored, which shares work across a cell's corners: six multiplies per three-dimensional sample rather than twenty-four.
/// Then one shift, one multiply, and the top nibble of the product, its best-mixed part.
///
/// Four bits is all a gradient needs, so that is the whole hash.
/// A byte-wide avalanche spent three multiplies per corner on bits nothing read.
/// Checked against it the sixteen codes are uniform to well under a percent, with adjacent corners as independent as the avalanche managed.
/// A linear pre-mix with a single multiply was not: adjacent corners correlated six-fold, which reads as lattice patterns.
///
/// Both tiers share the hash, so the 16-bit field is the 8-bit one at finer resolution rather than an unrelated field.
///
/// The implementation is written fresh and integer throughout: the hash and the fade table are ours, and the gradient trick is Perlin's.
