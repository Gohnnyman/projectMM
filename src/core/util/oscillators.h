/// @defgroup oscillators An oscillator bank
/// @{
/// Independent low-frequency oscillators, advanced once per frame and read as often as an effect likes.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// Every animated quantity in a generative field is an oscillator.
/// Where a shape sits, how far a coordinate is displaced, how fast a layer rotates, how bright it is this instant.
/// Written by hand that is a phase member, a waveform call and a range map per quantity.
/// That is why an effect animating several things grows a row of near-identical members and a block of arithmetic in its tick.
/// The bank is that pattern owned once: declare how many, set each one's rate, waveform and output range, advance the bank, then read.
///
/// ## Why a bank rather than loose oscillators
///
/// Advancing is one pass, so the cost is per frame rather than per pixel.
/// A pixel loop reads values already computed, which is the whole point when a field samples the same oscillator thousands of times.
///
/// Phases are held together, so oscillators keep their relationships.
/// Two layers at the same rate a quarter-cycle apart stay that way for as long as the device runs.
/// That is what makes a composition read as deliberate rather than as drift.
///
/// ## How a bank is used
///
/// Once per frame the bank is advanced to the current time, and a value is then read wherever it is needed, including inside a pixel loop.
/// Configuration happens in prepare, or whenever a control changes.
///
/// A rate change takes effect from that frame without jumping the phase, which is what live reconfiguration requires.
///
/// ## Why the range map divides rather than shifts
///
/// Dividing by the full range rather than shifting is the difference between an oscillator that reaches its stated maximum and one that stops a step short of it forever.
/// An effect sweeping a hue to its top would never arrive.
///
/// The intermediate is wide because a range spanning the full signed width overflows a narrow product.
/// A caller mapping onto pixel coordinates times a scale gets there sooner than it looks.
///
/// ## Standard shapes only
///
/// Sine, triangle, sawtooth and square, all from the 16-bit tier.
/// Anything richer is a combination of oscillators, which is the vocabulary these shaders are written in, rather than a new waveform here.
