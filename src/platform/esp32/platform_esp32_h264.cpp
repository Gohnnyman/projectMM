/// @defgroup platform_esp32_h264 Live streaming on the P4
/// The platform half of the encoder seam.
///
/// Where a desktop hands the whole job to an external encoder, this chip does all three parts itself.
/// The hardware encoder, our own muxer, and a segment ring served straight out of memory.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## No filesystem in the path
///
/// At one segment a second, writing them to flash would wear it out for no gain, a live segment being stale within seconds.
///
/// ## Why a worker task
///
/// The write is called from the render tick and must never block on an encode.
/// It copies the frame into a slot ring and returns, and the worker does the conversion, the encode and the muxing.
/// A full ring drops the newest frame, exactly as the desktop path does when its encoder falls behind.
///
/// ## An orphaned worker must not become a second producer
///
/// Stopping a worker detaches one that overruns its join deadline rather than freeing it, so an orphan can still be parked when the next start runs.
/// A running flag alone cannot gate that, since the new start sets it true again.
/// The orphan would then resume as a second producer on the one encoder handle and scratch buffer.
/// So each worker captures the generation it was spawned for and exits as soon as it is no longer current.
///
/// For the same reason the buffers are freed only once the worker has actually returned: a detached one is mid-encode holding raw pointers to them and to the encoder handle.
/// Freeing there would be a use-after-free plus a call into a deleted session, so leaking a few megabytes until the next start is the better trade.
///
/// ## The playlist advertises from the oldest plus a margin
///
/// Never the oldest itself, since that slot is the next one rotation overwrites and a player fetching it races the encoder and gets nothing.
/// The margin is what a player has left to fetch what it was promised, and the rest of the ring is its buffering budget.
/// On the bench, listing the true oldest failed immediately and listing only the newest few failed within about five seconds, and both spin forever.
///
/// ## The encoder task's core and stack
///
/// The second core, since the first runs the network stack and starving it stalls the very server that serves these segments.
/// The stack is twice what this started with, the encoder call chain plus our muxer having overflowed the smaller one.
/// It jumped into the maths library with a corrupted pointer and panicked in a loop.
/// The vendor's own example runs its encode from a comparable stack, and the muxer's frame loop sits on top of that.
/// The generation flag is cleared before the task starts rather than inside it.
/// A worker's first instruction runs only once the scheduler reaches it, so a stop landing in that window would free buffers it is about to encode from.
///
/// ## The QP window lets the bitrate govern
///
/// A near-fixed window pins quality, so the encoder spends whatever that costs and ignores the configured bitrate entirely.
/// Opening the window lets the bitrate actually govern what a frame may cost.
///
/// ## A segment claims the duration it holds
///
/// Claiming a flat second while delivering fewer frames makes a player run ahead of the stream until it stalls to re-buffer, which shows as segments arriving every 0.7 seconds.
///
/// ## The target check lives here, not in Kconfig
///
/// `depends on IDF_TARGET_ESP32P4` would hide MM_HLS from the component solver.
/// The solver reads that symbol to gate the esp_h264 dependency, so every non-P4 build then fails at cmake.
/// Catching it in the source instead names the cause, where the Kconfig route surfaces as a link error against a missing hardware encoder.
///
/// ## The ring's depth is a lifetime, not a cache
///
/// A segment survives its kept-seconds after it closes.
/// That is the whole budget a player has to parse the playlist, fetch, and buffer before what it asked for is recycled.
/// Browsers want several seconds of that.
///
/// ## A served segment is reserved
///
/// `hlsSegment` hands out a pointer the caller reads AFTER the lock drops, so the encoder must not recycle that slot underneath it.
/// Serving is far shorter than the time the ring takes to lap, but "usually in time" is not a lifetime guarantee.
