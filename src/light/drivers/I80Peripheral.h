/// Output driver: parallel 8-or-16-lane WS2812B over the ESP-IDF esp_lcd i80 bus, the scale path on all three i80-capable ESP32 families. RMT gives a chip 4-8 channels; this gives 8-16 lanes for the wall time of one. The shared body lives in ParallelLedDriver and the wire format in ParallelSlots.h.
///
/// Prior art: Adafruit's LCD_CAM discovery, hpwit's I2SClockless lineage, FastLED's S3 driver. Architecture studied and never copied, on IDF's esp_lcd rather than the raw registers.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// **One API, two peripherals.** ESP-IDF exposes one public i80 API and routes it to whatever the
/// silicon has: LCD_CAM on the S3, P4 and S31, and the I2S peripheral on the classic, its only route past 8 lanes. They are mutually exclusive per chip, so `lanesAvailable()` reads whichever lane count is non-zero. Named for the bus, since two peripherals serve it.
///
/// **The 3-slot-per-bit wire contract.** Each WS2812 bit becomes three bus slots at
/// 2.67 MHz, a 375 ns slot: every active lane HIGH, the data bits, then all LOW. A 1 is HIGH 750 ns and a 0 375 ns, approximating RMT's 700/350 rather than the lineage's ~416 ns. That stays under the 380 ns T0H max newer WS2812B revisions spec.
///
/// Both silicon paths do whole-frame chained DMA. So the classic I2S path is WiFi-underrun-immune by construction, and needs none of the ISR-refilled ring the lineage requires.
