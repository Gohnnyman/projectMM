/// Effect: a warped, kaleidoscopic noise field in polar coordinates.
/// @card PolarNoiseEffect.gif
///
/// Not a texture scrolling past the panel, but a field that turns and breathes inside it.
/// Three power functions compose to get there, and the effect is mostly parameter choices.
///
/// Prior art: Stefan Petrick's polar and noise vocabulary, and Inigo Quilez's domain warping.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The three power functions
///
/// `PolarLut` addresses the grid by angle and radius, which rotates the motion around the center.
/// That address never changes between frames, and computing it per pixel measured 39% of a frame on an S3.
/// `warp8` displaces the sample coordinate by a second field, so the field marbles rather than drifts.
/// `kaleido` folds the angle into mirrored wedges, and the symmetry is free before any sampling.
///
/// ## The controls are the cost knobs
///
/// `warp` is two noise samples plus its inner fbm, so at two octaves this is about four a pixel.
/// On a large wall drop `octaves` to 1, or `warp` to 0, and it degrades to a plain polar noise.
