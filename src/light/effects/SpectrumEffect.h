///
/// Two behaviors are what make a meter read as an instrument rather than a bar chart.
/// A bar rises fast enough to catch a transient and falls slowly enough to be readable.
/// A dot then marks the highest recent level and drifts down, showing what has passed.
///
/// Prior art: the standard VU and PPM meter ballistics, and WLED's GEQ for the band mapping.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The ballistics live in the toolbox
///
/// `smoothFollow` and `peakHold` are shared, so any effect wanting a meter gets the same feel.
/// GEQEffect hand-rolls its own peak tracker into a buffer sized to the column count instead.
/// `draw::bar` draws the columns too, so this effect owns no drawing loop.
/// What remains is the band-to-column mapping and the choice of colors, which is its own.
