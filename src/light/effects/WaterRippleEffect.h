/// Effect: a propagating water surface where drops ripple, reflect and interfere.
/// @card WaterRippleEffect.gif
///
/// Drops land and their rings spread outward, reflect off the edges and cross each other.
/// The crossing is what a formula cannot fake, since two rings meeting have to add and cancel.
///
/// Prior art: Hugo Elias's water surface algorithm, the standard demoscene form.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The wave equation, discretized
///
/// Keep the surface height at this step and the previous one.
/// The next height is the four neighbors averaged, minus the previous height, damped toward zero.
/// That one line is the wave equation, so the ripple is emergent rather than drawn.
///
/// RipplesEffect draws expanding rings from a closed-form radius instead.
/// That one is cheaper and always looks like clean circles, where this behaves like water.
///
/// Cost is two int16 buffers sized to the grid, and four neighbor reads a pixel a frame.
/// The memory scales with the fixture, so a large wall is worth checking against the budget.
/// Drop placement uses `hashInt`, so two devices put drops in the same places.
