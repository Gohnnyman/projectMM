/// Effect: falling balls that pile up and push each other aside.
/// @card BallpitEffect.gif
///
/// The half of the particle kernel Fireworks leaves untouched, since sparks never notice each other.
/// Here the balls rest on the floor, stack, and shove the pile aside rather than passing through.
///
/// Prior art: the WLED Particle System's ballpit family, where the impulse response is the kernel's.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## Piling is emergent
///
/// Gravity pulls everything down, the floor stops it, and contact between neighbors does the rest.
/// So the heap's shape is whatever the collisions produce, with nothing scripting it.
///
/// `tilt` shows why a force belongs in the kernel: one call turns the pit into a slope.
/// The whole heap then slides and re-settles, with no code here that knows about slopes.
///
/// ## Collisions are the non-linear part
///
/// They cost pair checks rather than one pass, so the pool is deliberately small.
/// `collide` runs once a frame before the move, and nearly every pair rejects on one axis alone.
