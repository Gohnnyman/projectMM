/// The effect keeps a short history of band frames, one entry per ring, and every light reads it.
/// A light's angle picks its band and its radius picks its age.
/// That is two table reads a light, which is cheaper than drawing bars.
/// It is volumetric for free: under the spherical mapping a cube's rings become shells.
///
/// ## It doubles as the diagnostic
///
/// Every sector is one band, so a stuck band shows as a sector that never moves or never dims.
/// `smooth` switches between the raw bands and the meter ballistic, which is the useful comparison.
/// `beat` adds the onset detector's hits as a white shockwave traveling out with the ripples.
