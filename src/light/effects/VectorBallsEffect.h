/// Effect: a rotating 3D object of shaded spheres, drawn with real perspective.
/// @card VectorBallsEffect.gif
///
/// The smallest complete demonstration of putting 3D on a panel.

///
/// Prior art: the demoscene vector-ball effect, where the projection and shading are the library's.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## Five steps, all of them shared
///
/// Two `shader::rotate` calls turn the object, one per axis.
/// `shader::project` puts it on screen, which is the one divide that is perspective.
/// A painter's-order pass sorts back to front and `shader::depthFade` shades by distance.
/// `draw::fillCircle` then draws each ball at the size that same divide gives it.
///
/// Painter's order matters: without it a far ball paints over a near one and the object inverts.
///
/// ## The shape is a point table
///
/// A cube's eight corners plus its six face centers: legible when it turns, trivial to sort.
/// A different shape is a different table, and the machinery is unchanged.
/// Cost is a rotate, a divide and a small disc per point, so `size` is the knob.
