/// Effect: randomly-turned arc tiles that join into endless winding paths.
/// @card TruchetEffect.gif
///
/// Randomly turned tiles with arcs at their edges join into continuous winding paths.
/// The pattern looks designed, and nothing designed it.
/// Nothing is stored either: this is one function of position and time, evaluated per pixel.
///
/// Prior art: Sebastien Truchet's tiling, revived by Cyril Smith in 1987.
/// The shader form follows the standard fract, hash and smoothstep idiom.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## The three moves most shader effects are built from
///
/// Space folding: `repeat` chops the plane into cells and returns the position inside one.
/// So the shader only has to draw a single tile, and the coordinate takes care of the hundreds.
///
/// Per-cell variation from position alone: `hashInt` on the cell index turns that tile.
/// Being a pure function, tile (7, 3) is always the same tile, and two devices agree on it.
///
/// Distance plus smoothstep: each tile is two arcs drawn as the distance to a ring.
/// The smoothstep across that distance is what stops a curve reading as a staircase.
///
/// Cost is two SDF evaluations and a hash per pixel, all integer, so any target runs it.
