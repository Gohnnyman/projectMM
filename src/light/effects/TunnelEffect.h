/// A texture mapped onto the inside of an infinite tube, so the viewer flies down it forever.

///
/// ## Angle and reciprocal are the two texture coordinates
///
/// Each pixel's angle around the center becomes one coordinate, and 1/r the other.
/// Since 1/r grows without bound toward the center, the texture compresses to a vanishing point.
/// Adding time to that coordinate then pulls the wall toward the viewer.
///
/// This is the polar vocabulary carried to its conclusion, with one reciprocal on top of it.
/// EchoEffect holds the gather primitive instead, reading the grid itself as a texture.
///
/// Cost: one divide, one atan and one noise sample a pixel, the divide being the expensive part.
