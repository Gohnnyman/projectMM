"""A catalog card's name is what links it to its own `## <Name>, details` section.

The renderer looked the name up by splitting the title on a hard-coded list of emoji.
Every card whose emoji was missing from that list kept the emoji in its name, found no
matching section, and rendered "Details: none yet" beside a section that existed: HUB75
(🟦), NDI and HLS (🖥️) all did, silently, and check_docgen used its own regex so it
reported the page clean. These pin the one shared `card_name`, with the emoji that broke
it and with one outside every list.
