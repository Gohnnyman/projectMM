"""build_esp32.find_idf_python() must select the venv by IDF *version*, not mtime.

ESP-IDF makes one Python venv per IDF version (`idf<major.minor>_py<X.Y>_env`) under
`~/.espressif/python_env/`. With two IDFs installed — e.g. a 5.5 kept alongside 6.1 for
a version-fallback experiment — sourcing either one's `export.sh` touches its venv, so
the last-activated venv is the newest by mtime. The old logic picked newest-by-mtime,
which meant a 6.1 build could be handed the 5.5 venv (its esptool is too old → idf.py
aborts with "The following Python requirements are not satisfied"). This pins that the
selection follows the *target* IDF version, so it's a function of what we build, not of
what was last sourced.

Imports the real function from scripts/build/build_esp32.py (no ESP-IDF needed).
Run: `uv run --with pytest pytest test/python -q`.
