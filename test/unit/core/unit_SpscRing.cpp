// @module SpscRing

// The lock-free single-producer single-consumer ring behind desktop audio capture: the
// miniaudio callback thread pushes samples, AudioService's polled tick pops them. These tests
// pin the contract a consumer can rely on: strict FIFO order across index wrap, drop-newest
// on overflow with an honest accepted-count, and an unbroken sequence under real two-thread
// concurrency.
