/// @module JsonSink

/// Pins that every value writeNumber emits is parseable JSON.
///
/// JSON has no NaN and no infinity, and the whole-value test casts to long long, which is undefined behavior for those and for any magnitude past what a long long holds. A document carrying `nan` or `inf` is rejected wholesale by a browser's parser, so one bad reading would lose the entire state frame rather than the one field that produced it.
