///
/// ## Why the buffers are a thread-local ring
///
/// Thread-local because the concurrency test compiles from two threads and a shared buffer would hand each the other's source.
/// A ring because tests build tables of scripts that hold the pointers and use them later, where a single buffer would alias every row to the last written.
///
/// Both bounds are measured rather than guessed, at roughly four times the longest script and deepest table seen, and a caller past either owns its own string.
///
/// ## Which entry point a script declares
///
/// A layout, a modifier and an effect each look up a different name.
/// A test for one binding has to emit that name, or the script compiles and the binding finds nothing.
///
/// Wrap a bare statement body in the class and entry point a MoonLive script needs.
///
/// A script is a class: `class T { void tick() { … } }`. Nearly every test here is about ONE behavior inside that body (a loop counter surviving a call, a control keeping its value, a golden byte sequence).
/// Spelling the enclosing class out at every call site would bury the assertion under four lines of identical ceremony. This puts the ceremony in one place so a test reads as what it is about.
///
/// A test that is about the class shape itself passes its own complete source and skips this.

/// The same, naming the entry point the binding under test asks for.
