// @module JsonSink

// Pins JsonSink::detach() — the move-out that hands the built heap buffer to a caller who keeps it
// (the resumable WS state-frame send). The ownership contract: after detach the sink's destructor
// frees nothing (no double-free), the returned block is NUL-terminated and owned by the caller (free
// with platform::free), and detach is a no-op in socket/fixed mode. Run under ASAN, a leak or
// double-free here fails the build.
