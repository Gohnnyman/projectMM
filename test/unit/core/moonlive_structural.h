/// A field is absent when its flag is false: an instruction naming no frame offset, which is most of them, simply reports none.
///
/// The allocated frame size is read from the emitted instruction rather than recomputed.
/// A checker modeling the frame with its own copy of the formula agrees with the backend even when the backend is wrong.
/// That is how the first version of this check passed against the bug it was written for.
///
/// The register masks serve the call-clobber check: a windowed call rotates the register file, so every register the rotation covers holds the callee's leftovers unless the caller saved it.
