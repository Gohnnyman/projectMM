"""CodeQL's open alerts, read from GitHub — the Security tab as a card.

CodeQL runs in CI (.github/workflows/codeql.yml), not locally: it is the one layer of the
analysis stack that sees whole-program taint, and it earns that slot on the six network packet
formats we parse. But its findings live behind the Security tab, which means they are invisible
while working — a report nobody opens is a report nobody reads.

This FETCHES rather than scans. The CodeQL CLI would need a ~1 GB install and minutes per run to
reproduce what CI already computed, and the alert lifecycle (open / fixed / dismissed, tracked
across runs) is the part worth having — that is baselining we would otherwise build ourselves.
The trade is honest and stated in the output: this shows the last ANALYZED commit, so local edits
and unpushed commits are not in it.

Not a gate, like the rest of the stack (docs/testing.md § Static analysis): it reports, the human
judges. Exit is 0 whenever the fetch succeeded, whatever the findings — and non-zero only when the
answer is unknown (no `gh`, not authenticated, no network), because "I could not look" must never
render as "nothing found".

Usage:
  uv run moondeck/check/check_codeql.py                  # open alerts, worst first
  uv run moondeck/check/check_codeql.py --state fixed    # what has been resolved
  uv run moondeck/check/check_codeql.py --all            # every state, including dismissed
  uv run moondeck/check/check_codeql.py --module HueDriver
